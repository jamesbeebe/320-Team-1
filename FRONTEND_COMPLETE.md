## 🔌 Backend Integration

### What You Need to Do:

1. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   # Update with your backend URL
   ```

2. **Implement backend endpoints**
   See `BACKEND_INTEGRATION.md` for complete API specifications

3. **Test the integration**
   - Authentication flow
   - Class management
   - Study groups
   - Chat functionality

### Key Integration Points:
- Auth: `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/register`
- Classes: `/api/classes/*`
- Study Groups: `/api/study-groups/*`
- Chat: `/api/chat/*` + WebSocket

All service methods are documented in `BACKEND_INTEGRATION.md`

## 📱 User Flow

1. **First Visit** → Login/Signup
2. **New User** → Onboarding (Add Classes)
3. **Returning User** → Dashboard (My Classes)
4. **Select Class** → Class Details
   - View/Join Study Groups
   - See Classmate Compatibility
   - Chat with Class

## 🎯 Key Features

### Current (with Mock Data)
- ✅ Full authentication UI
- ✅ Class search and enrollment
- ✅ Study group management
- ✅ Classmate compatibility display
- ✅ Chat interface
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Error handling in forms
- ✅ Loading states

### Ready for Backend
- ✅ Service layer complete
- ✅ API client with token management
- ✅ WebSocket support prepared
- ✅ Auth context for global state
- ✅ Proper error handling structure

### Future Enhancements (Optional)
- User profiles with avatars
- Direct messaging
- Notifications
- Calendar integration
- Advanced search/filters
- Email verification
- Password reset

## 📊 Matching Algorithm Integration

The compatibility percentages in the Classmates view are currently mock data (95%, 88%, etc.). 

**To integrate your matching algorithm:**

1. Update the backend endpoint `/api/classes/{classId}/classmates` to calculate and return compatibility scores

2. The frontend expects this format:
   ```javascript
   {
     classmates: [
       {
         id: "user123",
         name: "Brian C.",
         initials: "BC",
         compatibility: 95  // Your algorithm result (0-100)
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. The UI will automatically:
   - Sort by compatibility (highest first)
   - Show color-coded progress bars
   - Display percentage

## 🎨 Customization

### Colors
Edit `frontend/app/globals.css`:
```css
:root {
  --primary-red: #EF5350;
  /* Change to your preferred color */
}
```

### Components
All components in `components/ui/` are fully customizable:
- Button variants
- Input styles
- Card appearances
